## How to load the template into your Overleaf

1. Download a copy of the template by clicking [here](https://github.com/e61-Institute/research-note-template/zipball/master) (or by clicking on the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP").
2. On the [Overleaf website](https://www.overleaf.com/project), click on "New Project", then "Upload Project".
3. Drag and drop the downloaded Zip file as per the instructions.
4. Change the LaTeX compiler to XeLaTeX, otherwise nothing will compile: click on "Menu" in the top-left corner, go to the "Settings" section, click the drop-down box next to "Compiler", select "XeLaTeX".

## Separating out the main note from the appendices

Read this if you would like to create separate PDFs for the main body of the research note and the appendices. 

This can be done using the `pagesel` package that is conveniently commented out in the template. This package allows you to select which pages of a document to render as a PDF.

How to use:

1. Uncomment the line of the code containing the package `\usepackage[3-6]{pagesel}`.
2. Render the PDF for the main text by selecting the pages, e.g. render pages 1-2 by setting the option `\usepackage[1-2]{pagesel}`.
3. Render the PDF for the appendix by selecting the remaining pages, e.g. `\usepackage[3-6]{pagesel}`.

### References lists

LaTeX uses `.bib` files to store references (see [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Using_bibliographies_on_Overleaf) for more). These can be prepared manually, but why do things manually when you could automate them. 

If you like, we have access to [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-manager/library/all-references/), which is a reference manager. It is very good. Your Mendeley reference library can then be automatically synced with your Overleaf references for a particular document by following the instructions [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_to_link_your_Overleaf_account_to_Mendeley_and_Zotero).
